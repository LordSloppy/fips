# Abstract
This FIP proposes to extend FIO Protocol functionality to enable FIO Block Producers to use [regproducer](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/pages/api/fio-api/#options-regproducer) to update their producer information.

## Modified actions
|Contract|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|eosio|regproducer|/register_producer|Modifies the action to allow the updating of specific fields.|

# Motivation
Currently, [regproducer](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/pages/api/fio-api/#options-regproducer) can only be used to create new producer records. If a producer calls `regproducer` to update their information, they get an error: `Already registered as a producer.` FIO Block Producers have requested an enhancement to the protocol to allow the use of `regproducer` to update their information.

# Specification
This is an early draft of the FIP intended for discussion and detail specification has not yet been created.

## Modified actions

Allow transferring of locked tokens to existing accounts.
