# Abstract
This FIP proposes **FIO Co-op**, an on-chain program for creating economic incentives for FIO end-users to adopt the protocol early.

# Motivation
The FIO Protocol is subject to the network effect, meaning the more participants adopt it, the more useful it is to all.

To accelerate the adoption, on-chain incetives for integrators in form of [TPID rewards](https://kb.fioprotocol.io/fio-chain/fees#fee-distribution) and [New User Bounties](https://kb.fioprotocol.io/fio-token/token-distribution#new-user-bounties), as well as for block producers in the form of [rewards](https://kb.fioprotocol.io/fio-token/token-distribution#new-user-bounties) and [reserves](https://kb.fioprotocol.io/fio-token/token-distribution#block-producer-reserves) are built into the FIO Chain.

Currently, there are no incentives for end-users. When registered early, a FIO Address has limited use across the industry until more participants integrate it into their products and more end-users join the network. Yet early adopters add significant value to the network by helping it grow and therefore should be incetivized.

Key objective for FIO Co-op:
* Encourage early adoption of the FIO Protocol by end-users
* Cause users to seek FIO-integrated applications
* Entice users to spread the word about FIO to others
* Encourage users to hold FIO tokens for long periods of time

# Specification
## Overview

### Use cases

## New actions

# Rationale
When designing an end-user incetive program, the following was considered:
* Must be sybil attack proof
* Should provide greater economic benefits the early the user participates
* Payouts should be based on the future economic inputs to the FIO Protocol
* Should not add friction to the process of adopting the FIO Protocol
* Should enable permanent residual income as long as the user continues to participate

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility

# Future considerations
