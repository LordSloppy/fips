# Abstract
Functionality proposed in this FIP is intended to make wrapping of FIO Tokens and Domains easier.

Wrapping cannot be accomplished entirely inside the FIO Protocol and therefore will not be possible with this FIP alone. This FIP only defines the functionality required in FIO Protocol. For detailed overview of the greater initiative see [Enable FIO Token and Domain NFT wrapping](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WP/pages/7012357/Enable+FIO+Token+and+Domain+NFT+wrapping).

Proposed new actions:
|Action|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|
|wrapdomain|wrap_fio_domain|Transfers FIO Domain to designated FIO account on the way to another chain.|
|unwrapdomain|unwrap_fio_domain|Transfers FIO Domain to designated FIO account back from another chain.|
|wraptokens|wrap_fio_tokens|Transfers FIO Tokens to designated FIO account on the way to another chain.|
|unwraptokens|unwrap_fio_tokens|Transfers FIO Tokens to designated FIO account back from another chain.|
|regoracle||Registers an Oracle.|
|setoraclefee||Allows Oracle to set Oracle fee.|
||get_oracle_fees|Fetches Oracles fees.|

# Motivation
It is believed that the ability to wrap FIO Tokens and Domain NFTs will be beneficial to the FIO Community. It will open up new use cases for FIO Tokens and Domains such as:
* Enable FIO Domains to be traded on NFT trading sites such as Open Sea as ERC-721s.
* Enable FIO tokens to be used in a rapidly growing Defi ecosystem such as Uniswap which rewards token holders for providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges.

# Specification
## Overview
This FIP proposes a new wrapping system contract (controlled by eosio account or block producers). It will allow pre-defined oracles to transfer FIO Tokens or Domains owned by the smart contract if all oracles agree to do so.

### Use cases
### Registering oracles
* Each Oracle is registered using *regoracle* action. Only BPs can register Oracles via an msig.

### Setting oracle fees
* Each Oracle submits a fee for token and domain wrapping using *setoraclefee*.
* Oracle fee is set to median of fees provided by all Oracles.

### Wrapping FIO Domain
* User A wants to wrap FIO Domain to P public address on C chain.
* User A fetches amount of Oracle fee using */get_oracle_fees*.
* User A executes *wrapdomain* action and passes in:
  * *fio_public_key* of wrapping smart contract account
  * *fio_domain* (D) to wrap
  * *public_address* (P) on chain C where domain should be delivered
  * *chain_code* C
  * *max_oracle_fee* - maximum amount of FIO user A is willing to pay the Oracles
* FIO Domain is transferred to wrapping smart contract account
* Oracle fee is transferred from user A and distributed evenly to all registered Oracles.
* Oracles monitor every block looking for *wrapdomain* action (not covered by this FIP).
* Once detected Oracles trigger minting of FIO Domain NFT on another chain (not covered by this FIP).

### Un-wrapping of FIO Domain
* User A wants to unwrap FIO Domain to P public address on FIO Chain.
* User A executes action on another chain (not covered by this FIP):
* Oracles monitor every block on another chain (not covered by this FIP).
* Once detected each Oracle executes *unwrapdomain* action and passes in:
  * *fio_public_key* where to transfer domain
  * *fio_domain* (D) to transfer
* Once the last Oracle executes *unwrapdomain* action, FIO Domain is transferred to P.

### Wrapping FIO Tokens
* User A wants to wrap X FIO Tokens to P public address on C chain.
* User A fetches amount of Oracle fee using */get_oracle_fees*.
* User A executes *wraptoken* action and passes in:
  * *fio_public_key* of wrapping smart contract account
  * *amount* (X) of FIO tokens to wrap
  * *public_address* (P) on chain C where tokens should be delivered
  * *chain_code* C
  * *max_oracle_fee* - maximum amount of FIO user A is willing to pay the Oracles
* X FIO Tokens are transferred to wrapping smart contract account.
* Oracle fee is transferred from user A and distributed evenly to all registered Oracles.
* Oracles monitor every block looking for *wraptoken* action (not covered by this FIP).
* Once detected Oracles trigger minting of wrapped tokens on another chain (not covered by this FIP).

### Un-wrapping of FIO Tokens
* User A wants to unwrap X FIO Tokens to P public address on FIO Chain.
* User A executes action on another chain (not covered by this FIP):
* Oracles monitor every block on another chain (not covered by this FIP).
* Once detected each Oracle executes *unwraptoken* action and passes in:
  * *fio_public_key* where to transfer tokens
  * *amount* (X) of FIO tokens to transfer
* Once the last Oracle executes *unwraptoken* action, the tokens are transferred to P.

# Rationale
Even though wrapping could be accomplished without any new functionality being added to the FIO Protocol, it would be hard. Specifically:
* [/transfer_fio_domain](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0001.md#transfer-fio-domain) does not support memo to pass intended destination public address on another chain. This would require the information to be exchanged off-chain.
* [/transfer_tokens_pub_key](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/transfer-tokens-pub-key/transfer-tokens-pub-key-model) does not support memo either. [/transfer_tokens_fio_add](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0011.md#transfer-fio-tokens-using-fio-address) or [/record_obt_data](https://developers.fioprotocol.io/api/api-spec/reference/record-obt-data/record-obt-data-model) would have to be used, but even then the information would have to be provided as part of free-form memo field.

get_wrapped_fio_domains and get_wrapped_fio_tokens calls were considered, but deemed unnecessary, as [selected FIO Token and Domain NFT wrapping solution](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WP/pages/7012357/Enable+FIO+Token+and+Domain+NFT+wrapping) will rely on monitoring every block.
