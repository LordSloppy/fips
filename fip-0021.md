### The specific numbers in this FIP are still being modeled and may change before the FIP is accepted.

# Abstract
This FIP proposes **FIO Staking**, an on-chain program which rewards users for participating in blockchain governance.

Token supply modifications:
|Token group|Before FIP|After FIP|
|---|---|---|
|Staking Rewards Pool|0|20,000,000|
|FIO Address Giveaways|125,000,000|105,000,000|

**Total token supply increase/(decrease): 0**

Modified actions:

# Motivation
The FIO Protocol is subject to the network effect, meaning the more participants adopt it, the more useful it is to all.

To accelerate the adoption, on-chain incentives for integrators in the form of TPID rewards and New User Bounties, as well as for block producers in the form of rewards and reserves are built into the FIO Chain. Currently, there are no incentives for end-users. Yet early token holders add value to the network by voting for block producers and helping the network grow.

This FIP proposes an on-chain staking functionality, which awards user Staking Rewards for taking an active role in the FIO Protocol governance.

# Specification
## High-level
### Staking
User can stake any available amount in their account at any point in time. To stake, the account has to have voted or proxied tokens in their account within the preceding 30 days.

### Staking Reward Token
When user stakes FIO Tokens they exchange FIO Tokens for Staking Reward Tokens (SRTs) at then current Rate of Exchange. Future Rate of Exchange and therefore annualized return cannot be determined at the time of staking as it is dependent on future fees collected and tokens staked. However:
* Rate of Exchange can only go up, so user is guaranteed at least their principal back.
* The sooner they stake the better the Rate of Exchange.
* The more fees collected, the higher the Rate of Exchange.

### Unstaking
User can unstake any staked amount in their account at any point in time. When user unstakes their FIO Tokens they will exchange SRTs into FIO Tokens at then current Rate of Exchange. Since the Rate of Exchange is likely to be higher at time of unstake, they will receive more FIO Tokens than staked. The unstaked amount is locked in the account for a period of 7 days before it can be transferred or staked again.

### Source of additional FIO Tokens:
Any time a fee is collected, 25% (coming out of BP rewards) will be redirected toward staking rewards. In addition, if that amount in a day is less than 20,000 FIO, new tokens will be minted to ensure that amount is at least 20,000. These extra Staking Reward Reserves will be capped at 20M new tokens. The Foundation will burn 20M FIO Tokens from Address Giveaway bucket.

### Rewards for TPID



## Modifications to existing actions
### [trnsloctoks](fip-0020.md)
Added logic to award Staking Rewards.
#### Request
No changes
#### Processing
* If lock contains a single period and number of seconds is equal to number specified in above table, compute Staking Rewards, mint tokens, transfer tokens to payee_public_key account, update lock schedule.
#### Exception handling
No changes
#### Response
No changes

# Rationale
A bond yield formula was considered instead of fixed rate of return for pre-specified periods, but was not chosen because:
* It's easier to control specific rates for specific periods directly rather than via formula.
* The Foundation may want to lock tokens for private sales without the Staking Rewards being attached.
* It's likely that the user interface will offer limited options for lock duration anyway.

# Implementation
## Token burning
Foundation will burn 20,000,000 FIO Tokens from [FIO Address Giveaways](https://kb.fioprotocol.io/fio-token/token-distribution#tokens-minted-over-time) using retire action being implemented in [FIP-22](fip-0022.md).

# Backwards Compatibility
No impact on existing functionality.

# Future considerations
May be considered in the future:
* Fee distribution may be modified to redirect a portion of fess paid to the replanish the Staking Rewards Pool
