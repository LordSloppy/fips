# Abstract
As described in the knowledge base, the genesis of the FIO chain included 10M tokens set aside for Block Producer Reserves, to be minted each day as needed if the normal fee distribution falls below 50k FIO tokens. In December 2020, these reserves were exhausted and the current BP pay has dropped significantly. During the recent BP call, it was discussed that the pay from organic on-chain activities is about 10% of what it was with the BP reserves. The reduced pay has a direct impact on BPs operating efficiently which is essential for the reilience of the FIO network. To address this issue, FIO Foundation and BPs have been discussing multiple proposals focused on short-term and long-term scenarios.
This proposal is aimed at implementing a short-term solution to address the issue now and to secure some more time to work on a permanent solution.

Proposed new actions:
Contract|Action|Description|
|---|---|---|
|fio.treasury|Updating BPMAXRESERVE|Need to update the BPMAXRESERVE value from 10000000000000000(10M Tokens) to 15000000000000000(15M Tokens) |

# Motivation
BPs/Validators are the essential part of the network. Today, FIO Blockchain is supported by 36 validators who are providing the infrastructure and participating in network governance activities. They ensure the security and reliability of the network. In order for a validator to support FIO Blockchain, there are numerous costs involved like infrastructure costs, payroll costs, network costs etc. Though the payroll costs vary in different countries and the way you source the infrastructure(cloud vs bare metal) will have an impact on total costs, on average for a validator to offer services it's expected to cost around 5000$/month($4000 - Salaries, $1000 - Network & Infrastructure).

The current pay of active validators is around $300/month and for standbys it's around 150$/month. So to have sustainable network we need to start compensating the validators faily for there services.

# Specification
During the recent BP call on this topic, the BPs and the foundation agreed that we need a quick and temporary solution for BP pay right now to ensure the sustainability of the network. The current consensus is to change BPMAXRESERVE to be something greater than 10M and burning some of the Foundation owned tokens or the 38M tokens that are already locked [forever](https://fioprotocol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/10616911/Mainnet+locks).

This is the code where the treasury mints the Block Producer Reserve tokens: https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio.contracts/blob/cd048d6d7b10dbd0e0d46fe8b5fd063f4bc4c8a4/contracts/fio.treasury/fio.treasury.cpp#L196

So by updating the BPMAXRESERVE value from 10000000000000000(10M Tokens) to 15000000000000000(15M Tokens) we should be able to sustain for a couple of months before finding a permanent solution. 

The additional 5 Million tokens will give BPs a decent pay for more than 100 days(50000FIO/day). The additional data generated during these 100 days can also help the community evaluate a permanent solution.

# Rationale
The key points to consider are ensuring the BPs are well incentivized to secure the network and greater FIO Token community is not over-paying for that service of securing the chain and adding additional value to the FIO community as Block Producers do. In order to do this, we need to take some fast action right now and take time to evaluate more ideas in Q1 2021.

# Implementation
A small code update has to be done [here](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio.contracts/blob/cd048d6d7b10dbd0e0d46fe8b5fd063f4bc4c8a4/contracts/fio.treasury/fio.treasury.cpp#L13) to 15Million Tokens instead of the current 10Million Tokens. 

# Future considerations
In future, this variable can be passed through an action with a BP multi-sig.
