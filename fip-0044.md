# Abstract
This FIP proposes to extend the FIO Protocol functionality to enable FIO Domains to be mapped to [DNS Resource Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Resource_records) which would make them usable within existing  [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) applications, such as mapping a FIO Domain to a website.

# Motivation
Neither FIO Crypto Handles (FCHs) nor FIO Domains currently support the resolution of Internet Protocol addresses akin to [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System). Some community members have expressed interest in adding such capability to the FIO Protocol as it would add more utility to the FIO Domains and the FIO Protocol overall. Since FIO Chain is a full decentralized blockchain, hosting DNS mappings on it would allow them to be immutable and not subject to centralized control.

# Specification
This is an early draft of the FIP intended for discussion and detail specification has not yet been created.

## New actions
### Add/Modify/Delete DNS Record
Will map FIO Domain to DNS record following [RFC-1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-3.2.1) format:
* NAME - FIO domain name to which this resource record pertains.
* TYPE - Two octets containing one of the RR TYPE codes.
* CLASS - Two octets containing one of the RR CLASS codes.
* TTL - A 32 bit signed integer that specifies the time interval that the resource record may be cached before the source of the information should again be consulted
* RDATA - A variable length string of octets that describes the resource

Example request
```
{
	"name": "alice",
	"type": "A",
	"class": "IN",
	"ttl": 300,
	"rdata": "104.26.11.44",
	"max_fee": 1000000000,
	"tpid": "rewards@wallet",
	"actor": "aftyershcu22"
}
```

## New getters
### Get DNS Record
Will fetch DNS record associated with supplied name and record type.

Example request
```
{
	"name": "alice",
	"type": "A"
}
```

# Rationale
The goal of DNS mappings would be to make them compatible with the existing DNS conventions, which expects the name to have the format of 'subdomain.domain.tld'.

Adding DNS mapping capabilities to the FCH would fail to achieve this goal and could potentially be confusing to users due to the FCH format which contains the '@' symbol, e.g. purse@alice. Therefore, this FIP proposes adding mapping capability to FIO Domains instead.

Furthermore, the FIO Protocol does not currently support the notion of sub-domains, or top level domains (TLDs). A _.fio_ TLD could be appended by the integrating application to indicate that resolution request should be directed to the FIO Protocol. _.fio_ TLD is not currently supported by ICANN and therefore there would not be any collisions with traditional DNS. Foundation for Interwallet Operability could consider funding the _.fio_ TLD application with ICANN in the future once TLD applications resume. If [Alternative DNS Roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_DNS_root), such as [Handshake](https://handshake.org/) gain more global traction, those could be used instead. The concept of FIO sub-domains is not proposed in this FIP, but could be considered in the future.

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
None anticipated.

# Future considerations
TBD
